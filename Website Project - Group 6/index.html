         <h2>About Us</h2>    
         <p> We're just a group of guys who have a passion for sports and enjoy watching any sport. We have all had those times when we ask ourselves, "Are the Packers playing today? Do the Cavaliers play today?" We thought we could make a website where all games coming up are announced and all previous games were displayed. We have tried really hard to make this website as simple and smooth as possible. Do you have any suggestions? Let us know by emailing us at sportsnetwork@gmail.com.
