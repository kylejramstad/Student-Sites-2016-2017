        <p1>After sensing that Silk was released from captivity by Spider-Man,Morlun stated that the Great Hunt,where he and his family would kill every Spider-Totem in the Multiverse, had begun.
            As the inheritors killed numerous Spider-themed heroes,the time-displaced Spider-Man(Otto Octavius) created a team to fight the enemies.
            Meanwhile,other villains were embarked in similar quests. Earth 1204's Goblin tried to gather the DNA from different Spider-Men across multiple universes,and the Multiversal Sinister Six attempted to conquer numerous universes by taking the Isotope-8 from one in specific.
            And while the Great Hunt takes place, the Spider-Army must find a way to defeat Morlun,Karn,and the rest of the Inheritors once and for all</p1>

Lottie is a chronic self-loather who struggles to create meaningful relationships in her Twitter-dominated life. Plus, there's the fact that she suffers from severe allergies, hence the "Snotgirl" moniker.</p1>
