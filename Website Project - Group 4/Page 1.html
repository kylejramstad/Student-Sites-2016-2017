  <h3>The Good</h3>
  <p>The good thing about this series is that it has an interesting plot from the start, although the very beggining, episode 1, might has a boring start to the series. But as it continues it gets a little more intersting and makes the audience engaged to the series. </p>
    <h3>The Bad</h3>
    <p>The bad thing about this series is that it is only 12 episodes and the reason for that is because the directors did not have any ideas left to come up with more episodes. For the same reason the series might be a little repetitive.</p>
