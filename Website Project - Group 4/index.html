         <p>We at Anime Central will be planning to do mostly reviews of anime. As well as news stories on recent anime related events. Right now we only have 3 reviews but we plan on expanding this into hundreds. Our reviews are only of our opinion towards the anime. We will be updating the website frequently to make it the best as we can.</p>
         <P>If you have any suggestions feel free to contact us! Our contact info is located in the About Us section.</P>
