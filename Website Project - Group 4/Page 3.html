   <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>One Piece is one of the best shounen to enjoy with family and friends. The anime is about a young boy name Luffy who promised a famous pirate that he was going to be one of the strongest pirates just like him. To make it official Luffy was given a straw hat which he had to give to the famouse pirate one day at sea .Thats how Luffy became a pirate and not a marine.This anime consists of action, fantasy, and adventure. It's about morals, friendship, helping those in need, and following your dreams the farthest you can.</p>

 <h2>The Good</h2>
 <p>This shonen is very good and enjoyable. It is for everyone at any age when ever and how ever. All characters are different, which makes it even more interesting. They each have their own background story of what helped them chose a dream to follow. I think that it's very hard to choose which character should be the favorite. It's not all violence from just wanting to pick trouble but violence to help those in need. It shows that in even the worst cases their are people that are good and try to change thing as much as they can using their morality. Many people have enjoyed it so much that is has been going on since july 19, 1997 and still going strong.</p>

     <h2>Final Words</h2>
     <p>Even though it is very intresting and its hard to stop watching it is a 4 out of 5 stars. It does has filler just like most anime series and it is to long for new viewers to catch up but yet again thats one of the reasons its so good that it keeps going. The one thing that made me remove that one star is the art. I understand that it is old but doest it realy have to be that bad. It is hard to write bad about this shonen but those are obviouse mistakes. Every thing about the shonen is 100% good and enjoyable. So the final rating is below.</p>
