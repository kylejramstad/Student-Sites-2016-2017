                 <h2>Environment Group</h2>
                <p>Starting an environment group can help the environment. The group can come together and help plant trees and plants for bees. Bees are slowly dying and we need them in order to survive. We need to help bees survive by doing this we can
                    help save the environment. Another thing that a group can do is go to beaches and pick up the trash that surrounds the ocean this will help animals when swimming. They tend to confuse trash with food so they eat it and they end up
                    dying if we clean up the ocean we can save marine animals as well.</p>
                <br>
                 <h3>Recycle</h3>
                <p>We as people can start to recycle if we recycle and clean up after ourselves by throwing awat our trash can help keep our land clean. In order to have clean water we can stop toxic waste and oil from spilling into the ocean and killing
                    our animals.We can help keep the land clean and safe if we work as a big group and help the environment.</p>
                <br>
                 <h4>Compost</h4>
                <p>We can start composting our waste and use it as soil for the plants and trees. We can also conserve energt and disconnect any outlets when they are not in use. Instead of using a dryer we can use a clothesline and hang your clothes out
                    in the sun.You can also stop buying disposible items. To conserve water we can take shorter showers, turn off your faucet when you brush your teeth, and if you wash your cat park it on your lawn and use a bucket and sponge to cleen
                    it and thn rinse it with the hose and turn it off between rinses parking it in your lawn can water the grass at the same time so this is a good idea.</p>
