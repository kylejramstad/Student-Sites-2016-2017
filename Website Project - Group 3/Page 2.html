         <h2>Effects of Industrialization</h2>
         <p>Industrailization took a huge role in effecting the environment. Factories and more buildings began to pop up in more and more places thus having to change the environment. Trees getting cut to make space for growing cities, digging up land, and using rivers for resources. All these took away animals habitats. The invention of the automobile also added to the affect on air pollution. Oil drilling has caused large  disasters, the BP oil spill in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico is considered one of the worst oil spills in U.S. history. An estimated 3.19 million barrels leaked into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 days straight. In gallons it would be 200 million gallons of crude oil that leaked into the gulf. It took almost three years to clean up most of the oil but the effects are still lingereing to this day. Many animals suffered from it. Since oil floats, most animals affected by oil spills are animals usually floating on thed sea surface like sea otters and seabirds. The oil stuck on to the bird's feathers and otter's fur reduced their ability to maintain there body temperature, thus killing them. More seabirds and are affected by oil spills then fishes and marine mammals</p><br>
         <h3>Air Pollution</h3>
         <p>The main cause of air pollution is caused by the burning of fossil fuels like coal, petroleum and other combustables used in factories. Vehicles like cars, trucks, airplanes, and trains also emmit a large amount of pollution. Farms also have a large role in creating air pollution. Factory farms release large ammounts of methane gas into the atmosphere, most of the methane gas released into the air comes from cows. Cows account for seven percent of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. Methane gas is much worse than carbon dioxide. Methange as is thirty times more potent as a heat trapping gas than carbon dioxide.</p></article>
