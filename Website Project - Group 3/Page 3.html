         <h2 class="gogreen"> Go Green </h2>
         <p >The green living movement encourages people to live in a more environmentally friendly way, and there are a number of different ways to <span style="color:green">"go green."</span> While most people are aware that going green is good for the Earth, they may not fully understand the extent of its impact. Going green has several positive side effects for the environment that contribute to cleaner water and air, preserve natural resources and reduce the impact of global warming. </p>
         <h3>Reduced Pollution</h3>
         <p>Going green helps the environment by reducing the amount of pollution that enters the soil, water and air. By using alternative energy sources and avoiding the burning of fossil fuels, recycling and reducing waste and driving more efficiently, fewer pollutants are released into the environment. For example, a study by the Environmental Protection Agency found that air quality in the United States is steadily improving but as of 2008, approximately 127 million Americans still live in areas with potentially hazardous levels of air pollution.</p>
