  <div class="ParagraphLeft"><p>With the modern technology today, our advanced weaponry today would dominate other weapons from World War 1 and World War 2. From planes, Naval Weaponry to small arms our technology and knowledge has exponentially expanded. With the firepower we have compared to the past we can see where and which parts we improved to methods that we kept the same.
        </p><p> World War 1 was the war that introduced some of the technologies used by the modern militaries today. Tanks and planes were both introduced during the First World War. Planes were first used for reconaissance but it did not take a long time for people to figure out that you can put a gun and use it to transport explosives. Tanks were also new technology. They were not as reliable or advanced as the tanks today but they did their job most of the time. </p><p>During the period between World War 2 and World War 1, there were a lot of new advanced in weaponry. The weapons were fundementally the same but were a lot better than the ones from the previous war. There were some advances towards the magazines and how fast it can fire.</p><p>Weapons have changed so much that anyone who has little knowledge of them can make a close guess on what period they came from just by looking at them. During the Cold War period, assault rifles, jet fighters, and main battle tanks became standard in militaries around the world. Weapons have come a long way. With our technology exponetially expanding who know if we will get better weapons in the future. </p></div>
